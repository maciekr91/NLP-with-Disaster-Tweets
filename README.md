# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

<img src="image.png" width="1000" height="500">

## General info

In this project we are provided with 10000 hand classified tweets. Some of them inform about real disasters and some are false flags. Our goal is to build machine model to distinguish one from the other. Dataset is divided 67/33 into training and test set. The evaluation is based on F1-score

[NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)

The project will be performed in Jupyter Notebook, using Python. 

## Project goals

Due to educational purpose of this project I set myself the following goals apart from the obvious goal of achieving the best possible prediction result:
- perform proper Exploratory Data Analysis including: finding hidden relationships between features, feature engineering, data unification and present all results in atractive graphical way,
- create a set of tools enabling to automate the process of seeking the best models, so we can easily check multiple sets of models, features, parameters etc.
- create SQL database to store information about models including: creating tables, updating, quering database etc.

## Final result

All side goals mentioned above were realized and best submission on Kaggle is above 'Auto ML Benchmark' To check project and detailed conclusions I invite you to read the Jupyter Notebook.
